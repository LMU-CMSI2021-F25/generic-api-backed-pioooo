# Advice of the Day

This React web application fetches and displays a random piece of advice from the Advice Slip API. It was built to demonstrate how to integrate an external API into a responsive and visually clear web interface. The user can refresh the advice, copy it to the clipboard, and see clear feedback whenever the app is loading or if an error occurs.

All network calls in the app are fully abstracted into asynchronous functions that live outside of the React components. The UI uses a gradient background, non-standard fonts from Google Fonts, Flexbox, and Grid layouts to structure and style the content. A fun image is also included in the footer for added visual interest. The design adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.

The app uses the Advice Slip API, which is a free and simple public API that returns random advice or advice based on a search term. Documentation for the API is available at https://api.adviceslip.com.

The deployed version of the application can be accessed directly at https://tzgp6p-5173.csb.app/ . This deployment shows a fully functional version of the project with responsive design, clean error handling, and proper asynchronous behavior.

This project was created for CMSI 2021 Web Application Development, Fall 2025, with Dr. Toal. It highlights fundamental skills in building API-backed React apps, organizing asynchronous code, and deploying a functional and aesthetically sound web application.
